== Installation ==

Install this plugin via WP-Admin > Plugins and connect your site via WooCommerce > Settings > Trusted Shops.

= Shortcodes =

`[ts_widget id="{widget_id}" product_identifier="{identifier}"]`
Use this shortcode to embed a specific widget, e.g.: `[ts_widget id="wdg-d6dc1e38-d43b-46aa-123e-232441"]`. Please mind that
embedding product-specific widgets by passing an identifier (e.g. sku, gtin, mpn) will only work on product-specific pages.

= Hooks =

All frontend-related hooks, e.g. to output Trustbadge, Trustcard and Widgets are managed in `src/Hooks.php`. External assets (e.g. the TS widgets script) are lazy-enqueued
via the [WordPress script API](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/) as soon as a widget is rendered.

For each widget position (e.g. `product_title`) a custom hooks is placed, e.g. `ts_easy_integration_single_product_title_widgets`. This way users may easily customize where/when
to output widgets by attaching custom scripts to it or removing the default logic to output the widget.

To render a widget, 2 templates exist:

1. `templates/widgets/product-widget.php` is used for product-related widgets.
2. `templates/widgets/service-widget.php` is used for service widgets.

== Overriding templates ==

Templates may be overridden in a (child-) theme. Overriding the `templates/widgets/product-widget.php` template in your theme 
by placing the original file in the following directory: `my-child-theme/woocommerce/widgets/product-widget.php`.

== Product attributes ==

= Brand =

WooCommerce does by default not provide a global brand attribute/setting for products. The `Package::get_product_brand()` method determines 
the brand for a certain product. By default, the logic searches for an attribute stored within the product data matching the keyword `Brand` (or a translated version of it). 
One might easily adjust the brand attribute name by using the filter `ts_easy_integration_product_brand_attribute_name`. E.g.:

```php
add_filter( 'ts_easy_integration_product_brand_attribute_name', function( $attribute_name, $product ) {
    // Maybe adjust the $attribute_name based on the WC_Product $product
    return $attribute_name;
}, 10, 2 );
```

Additionally the filter `ts_easy_integration_product_brand` is provided which allows filtering the actual brand per product.

```php
add_filter( 'ts_easy_integration_product_brand', function( $brand, $product ) {
    // Maybe adjust the $brand based on the WC_Product $product
    return $brand;
}, 10, 2 );
```

= GTIN, MPN, SKU =

The plugin uses product identifiers, which might not be provided by the Woo core (e.g. GTIN, MPN) for widgets, order exports and the Trustcard.
GTIN and MPN fields are provided through the WooCommerce edit product panel and stored as meta data, using the `meta_key` `_ts_gtin` and `_ts_mpn`.

Similar to the brand attribute, `Package::get_product_gtin()`, `Package::get_product_mpn()` and `Package::get_product_sku()` are used to retrieve the data.
Filters exist to adjust the attributes:

* `ts_easy_integration_product_gtin`
* `ts_easy_integration_product_mpn`
* `ts_easy_integration_product_sku`

Example filter-usage to adjust the GTIN:

```php
add_filter( 'ts_easy_integration_product_gtin', function( $gtin, $product ) {
    // Maybe adjust the $gtin based on the WC_Product $product
    return $gtin;
}, 10, 2 );
```
